For this project, my goal is to remind the audience or get the audience to think about wildlife conservation. For this, initially I have planned to have a solid background with a timeline (or sorts) in the middle, displaying different species from endangered to extinct (left to right). However, as I began, I thought it may be more visually appealing to include habitats so I divided the screen into water and land, and used the ‘heart rate’ as a divider. 

So far, as a complete novice, I have experimented with a lot of tools that GIMP has to offer. I have used the fuzzy select tool, free select tool, layer rotation, color desaturation, adding alpha layers, eraser tool (with different shapes), scale layer resizing, [ordering of layers](https://github.com/fathimashabnam/visual-argument-2019fall/blob/master/Progress%20Screenshot.png), and contrast/brightness adjustments. In the [Editing Progress screenshot](https://github.com/fathimashabnam/visual-argument-2019fall/blob/master/Editing%20Progress.png), I have captured just one of the many background edits. Here, I used a combination of fuzzy select, eclipse and eraser with a high zoom to remove as many pixels as possible to give a smooth image of the turtle behind the elephant (without edges disrupting the flow). 

I have put text as a placeholder here just to test the location/size. In my drawing board, I had wanted it to be below the animals, but I believe this image draws attention to the brightly colored sealife and animals first before the gray “sky” above with the text. This way, I can assume the audience will analyze the image before reading the text. However, I haven’t quite decided what words to use. I believe the quote by Jane Goodall, which true and inspiring, doesn’t exactly summarize the message I am conveying.

I believe the argument in my image is rather subtle. At first glance, the image is just showcasing wildlife, but upon further inspection, you notice the scuba diver at the left of the image cut off (the effect I aim for is as if he was encroaching into the image, hanging from the heartbeat rate). Then, you notice colored species in the middle and the gray scale species on the left. I don’t expect the audience to detect that from left to right is endangered to critically endangered species, but I hope that once they notice the gray scale species to be extinct. 

I will be adding words like “deforestation” and “poaching” in light gray faded above to drive the message through. I may end up making the heartbeat rate bigger, but I am not sure yet about this (I will decide based on peer feedback).
