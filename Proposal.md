<h1> Visual Argument Proposal </h1> 

For my visual argument, I want it to center around wildlife and habitat conservation. Recently, I have been watching a lot of nature documentaries, 
and despite being aware of nature threats, I was nonetheless surprised at the extent of neglect shown toward the issue of biodiversity conservation. 
The negative impacts of deforestation, poaching, introducing invasive species (including domestic pets), and climate change on different 
species that share this Earth are profound and heartbreaking. We tend to ignore issues that we don’t see and don't directly affect us, but 
we fail to realize that in the long term, losing beautiful aspects of nature will certainly impact future generations.

This is the message and reminder I hope to convey with my visual argument. To do this, I plan to create a timeline of sorts with humans 
on the left to pictures of recently endangered species in the middle and extinct animals on the right. Above this, there will be a heart 
rate flat lining, showing the limited time left. The extinct animals will be below the flat line part of the heart rate. I am also
considering making the extinct animals grayscale.

I initially planned to have the words, “Next, it could be us”, but I don’t think this conveys the message well. I am leaning toward using
a quote like “The greatest danger to our future is apathy” by Jane Goodall, but I haven’t decided which quote is ideal. I 
am also considering putting words like “deforestation”, “poaching” etc faded in the text part of the image, but I worry that it may make the image
crowded.
