Title: The Extinction Crisis

Topic: 
With the current rate of resource consumerism and disregard for the species we share the planet with, we are causing extinctions to happen [100 to 1,000 times the natural rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702436/). 
With this (along with many other disheartening statistics) in mind, I composed this image with hopes to bring awareness to how dire this situation really is. 
Loss of biodiversity and apathy toward wildlife conservation are two life-threatening phenomena. The looming effects of losing these species are very concerning, since 
we depend (as we have for thousands of years) heavily on the balance of nature for every aspect of survival. 
While the situation looks bleak, there is still hope. Our efforts can still help bring back the balance, and ultimately save our species. The question we must ask after understanding the 
consequences is, "Are we ready to put in the effort to save our planet?"
